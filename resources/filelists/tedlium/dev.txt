/store/store4/data/TEDLIUM_release1/tedlium/wavs/dev/d1f/d1fb8b0c-2b16-4552-a99d-6f5642844cce.wav|as a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects along with my adviser pattie and my collaborator jeevan kalanithi i started to wonder
/store/store4/data/TEDLIUM_release1/tedlium/wavs/dev/09d/09d31ebf-bcad-484b-b121-a0a7b0e6f2e1.wav|what if when we used a computer instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically arranging it the way we wanted
/store/store4/data/TEDLIUM_release1/tedlium/wavs/dev/cbb/cbb25ebd-ea91-41fb-9794-bbe300f998f8.wav|this question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer by building siftables
/store/store4/data/TEDLIUM_release1/tedlium/wavs/dev/be4/be4967e6-1f87-48b7-91c1-d9c84bd48215.wav|in a nutshell a siftable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie they're able to be moved around by hand they can sense each other they can sense their motion and they have a screen and a wireless radio
/store/store4/data/TEDLIUM_release1/tedlium/wavs/dev/ec2/ec268185-2af2-4d5a-9457-35c5b0d4be07.wav|most importantly they're physical so like the blocks you can move them just by reaching out and grasping and siftables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information
/store/store4/data/TEDLIUM_release1/tedlium/wavs/dev/f2f/f2f13d14-a162-4e60-99b4-fa26b578c669.wav|and as these tools become more physical more aware of their motion aware of each other and aware of the nuance of how we move them we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles so i'm going to start with some simple examples this siftable is configured to show video and if i tilt it in one direction it'll roll the video this way if i tilt it the other way
/store/store4/data/TEDLIUM_release1/tedlium/wavs/dev/df4/df45e44c-3414-4f67-83a1-379bb3d35b7d.wav|it rolls it backwards and these interactive portraits are aware of each other so if i put them next to each other they get interested
/store/store4/data/TEDLIUM_release1/tedlium/wavs/dev/e42/e4225349-26ea-49ac-9024-fa38d34f6645.wav|if they get surrounded they notice that too they might get a little flustered and they can also sense their motion and tilt
/store/store4/data/TEDLIUM_release1/tedlium/wavs/dev/d3e/d3e07e81-9212-4f4f-aba7-ed8c6c1958cb.wav|so one of the interesting implications on interaction we started to realize was that we could use everyday gestures on data
/store/store4/data/TEDLIUM_release1/tedlium/wavs/dev/0ba/0ba27cc3-196b-4a6f-86bd-780a0dabb23d.wav|like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid so in this case we've got three siftables configured to be paint buckets and i can use them to pour color into that central one where they get mixed if we overshoot we can pour a little bit back

/store/store4/data/TEDLIUM_release1/tedlium/wavs/dev/eea/eeaccbfb-b50e-445f-a869-e9bee61729be.wav|this is a fibonacci sequence that i'm making with a simple equation program here we have a word game that's kind of like a mash up between scrabble and boggle basically in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each siftable

/store/store4/data/TEDLIUM_release1/tedlium/wavs/dev/757/7578a16c-3c39-4ae1-9ba5-0af1f098feb1.wav|and then overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence so let's have a look

/store/store4/data/TEDLIUM_release1/tedlium/wavs/dev/137/137f169b-5445-425d-a147-fad74d3adeeb.wav|i can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo to one one way or the other

/store/store4/data/TEDLIUM_release1/tedlium/wavs/dev/357/357a872f-f1aa-4a5f-af83-979cef44ce81.wav|i can rearrange the sequence while it plays i don't have to plan it out in advance but i can improvise changing it making it longer or shorter as i go
/store/store4/data/TEDLIUM_release1/tedlium/wavs/dev/0df/0dfa8d28-7fcf-4762-baac-ef06684fdeba.wav|and now finally i can fade the whole sequence out using the volume siftable tilted to the left
